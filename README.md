#Health4all Auction Site

Health For All (http://hlth4all.org/) is a non-profit medical clinic which relies on doctors donating their time to provide for people who may not be able to afford health care. While the doctor’s time is free, the medical supplies that they use are not.

In order to raise funds for these activities, Health For All hosts many fund raisers throughout the year. One of these events is the Bra Art Auction where BCS locals refashion women’s lingerie in an artistic way to help raise funds.

In order to simplify the process at this auction, they have asked us to create a website to streamline the event and make record keeping much easier going forward.

The website works just like ebay, majority of the functionalies is done. Next on the agenda is major UI/UX design and integreation of paypal/google maps for payment and delivery functionality repectively.
