# Commonly used email steps
#
# To add your own steps make a custom_email_steps.rb
# The provided methods are:
#
# last_email_address
# reset_mailer
# open_last_email
# visit_in_email
# unread_emails_for
# mailbox_for
# current_email
# open_email
# read_emails_for
# find_email
#
# General form for email scenarios are:
#   - clear the email queue (done automatically by email_spec)
#   - execute steps that sends an email
#   - check the user received an/no/[0-9] emails
#   - open the email
#   - inspect the email contents
#   - interact with the email (e.g. click links)
#
# The Cucumber steps below are setup in this order.

module EmailHelpers
  def current_email_address
    # Replace with your a way to find your current email. e.g @current_user.email
    # last_email_address will return the last email address used by email spec to find an email.
    # Note that last_email_address will be reset after each Scenario.
    last_email_address || "example@example.com"
  end
end

# Reset the e-mail queue within a scenario.
# This is done automatically before each scenario.
#

Given /^(?:a clear email queue|no emails have been sent)$/ do
  reset_mailer
end

#
# Check how many emails have been sent/received
#

Then /^(?:I|they|"([^"]*?)") should receive (an|no|\d+) emails?$/ do |address, amount|
  expect(unread_emails_for(address).size).to eql parse_email_count(amount)
end



#
# Accessing emails
#

# Opens the most recently received email
When /^(?:I|they|"([^"]*?)") opens? the email$/ do |address|
  open_email(address)
end



#
# Inspect the Email Contents
#

Then /^(?:I|they) should see "([^"]*?)" in the email subject$/ do |text|
  expect(current_email).to have_subject(text)
end


When /^(?:I|they) click the first link in the email$/ do
  click_first_link_in_email
end

#
# Debugging
# These only work with Rails and OSx ATM since EmailViewer uses RAILS_ROOT and OSx's 'open' command.
# Patches accepted. ;)
